# Deploying to a hosting service 

A server usually needs to have a stable (static) IP address so that clients can find it and connect to it.

 [Heroku](https://heroku.com/), a commercial service that will host it on the web where it will be publicly accessible.

## Check in your code
Heroku (and many other web hosting services) works closely with Git: you can deploy a particular version of your code to Heroku by pushing it with the git push command. So in order to deploy your code, it first needs to be checked into a local Git repository.
