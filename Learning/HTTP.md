# HTTP's Request and Response Cycle

Common abbreviations

SGML - Standard Generalized Markup Language
HTML - HyperText Markup Language
HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol


### Example of a HTTP Request
``GET /pictures/kitty.jpg HTTP/1.1
//Header section of the request, and it contains addtional data about the request itself, all of it are optional except for the host
Host: www.google.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Connection: keep-alive
Accept: text/html
If-None-Match: b2arb0a1rba``



### Example of a HTTP Response
``HTTP/1.1 200 ok
//Header section of the response, and it contains addtional data about the response, all of it are optional except for the Content-Length, has it needs to tell the client how many bytes of data it should expect.
Content-Length: 16824
Server: Apache
Content-Type: Text/html
Date: Wed, 06 Apr 2016

<Binary data>``


GET: HTTP method that tells the server to send data to us
POST: HTTP method that instrusts the server to save the data we are sending. POST requests are potentially handled differently by proxies and the browser than GET requests.


## AJAX
AJAX is a group of web technologies that let you make a requests programmatically with Javascript instead of navigating and effectively reloading the entire website.

XMLHttpRequest (XHR) is the most common way of doing it.

FETCH: does the exact same thing but with a cleaner API, utilizing promises, therefore integrates much better with the rest of the modern Javascript APIs.

### Example of a FETCH Request
``fetch("/animals/cat.json")
.then (response => response.text ())
.then (body => console.log(body)); ``

With FETCH, you can utilize all the HTTP methods the protocol specifies and have full control of which headers are been sent, well most of all the headers.

### Another Fetch Request
``
fetch('password.txt', {
	'method': 'PUT',
	'headers': {
		'X-Udacity-Exercise': 'fetch is awesome!'
	}
}).then(function( response) {
	return response.text();
	}) .then(function ( data ) {
		console.log( data );
		});
	 ``

## HTTP Request
Everyrequest begins with a unique verb called a **method** and serves a specific purpose.

## Methods
1. GET
2. POST
3. PUT
4. DELETE
5. HEAD
6. OPTIONS


## Netcat
Netcat is a utility that's used for sending and receiving messages over a network connection. Netcat is known as the Swiss Army knife of networking tools, and we'll be using it to communicate directly with a server.

### Netcat command
There are many variations of Netcat, and the one I'll be using is accessed with the nc command.
