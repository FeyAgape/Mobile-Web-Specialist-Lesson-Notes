# Gulp 

[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is a tool that helps you out with several tasks when it comes to web development. It's often used to do front end tasks like:

Reloading the browser automatically whenever a file is saved
Spinning up a web server
Using preprocessors like Sass or LESS
Optimizing assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images
This is not a comprehensive list of things Gulp can do. If you're crazy enough, you can even build a static site generator with Gulp (I've done it!). So yes, Gulp is extremely powerful, but you'll have to learn how to use Gulp if you want to create your own customized build processes.
