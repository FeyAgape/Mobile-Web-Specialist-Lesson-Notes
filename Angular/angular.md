# Angular

## AngularJS is a JavaScript web framework aimed to make web apps simple to build and easy to maintain.

We'll start by building a simple AngularJS app. After making this app, we'll generalize a few steps that can be used to build more complex apps. By the end of this course, you'll be able to use this sequence of steps to jumpstart your own AngularJS apps.
