# STATELESS COMPONENTS FROM STATEFUL COMPONENTS

## Stateless Components Inherit From Stateful Components
Let's learn our first programming pattern! The programming pattern uses two React components: a stateful component, and a stateless component. "Stateful" describes any component that has a state property; "stateless" describes any component that does not.

In our pattern, a stateful component passes its state down to a stateless component.


## Build a Stateful Component Class
Let's make a stateful component pass its state to a stateless component. To make that happen, you need two component classes: a stateful class, and a stateless class.

A stateful component class named Parent

`//Parent.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
class Parent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { name: 'Frarthur' };
  }
  render() {
    return <div></div>;
  }
}`

Now our stateless component class.

`//Child.js
import React from 'react';
export class Child extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hey, my name is {this.props.name}!</h1>;
  }
}`


## Pass a Component's State
A <Parent /> is supposed to pass its state to a <Child />. Before a <Parent /> can pass anything to a <Child />, you need to import Child into Parent.js.

`//Parent.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Child } from './Child';
class Parent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { name: 'Frarthur' };
  }
  render() {
    return <Child name={this.state.name} />;
  }
}
ReactDOM.render(<Parent />, document.getElementById('app'));`

`//Child.js
import React from 'react';
export class Child extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hey, my name is {this.props.name}!</h1>;
  }
}`


## Don't Update props
You just passed information from a stateful component to a stateless component. You will be doing a lot of that. A component can change its state by calling this.setState(). You may have been wondering: how does a component change its props?

The answer: it doesn't!

A component should never update this.props. This is potentially confusing. props and state store dynamic information. Dynamic information can change, by definition. If a component can't change its props, then what are props for? A React component should use props to store information that can be changed, but can only be changed by a different component.

A React component should use state to store information that the component itself can change.
