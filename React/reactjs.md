## INTRO TO JSX
JSX Elements And Their Surroundings
JSX elements are treated as JavaScript expressions. They can go anywhere that JavaScript expressions can go.

That means that a JSX element can be saved in a variable, passed to a function, stored in an object or array...you name it.

### Here's an example of a JSX element being saved in a variable:

`const navBar = <nav>I am a nav bar</nav>;`

### Here's an example of several JSX elements being stored in an object:

`const myTeam = {
  center: <li>Benzo Walli</li>,
  powerForward: <li>Rasha Loa</li>,
  smallForward: <li>Tayshaun Dasmoto</li>,
  shootingGuard: <li>Colmar Cumberbatch</li>,
  pointGuard: <li>Femi Billon</li>
};`


## Attributes In JSX
JSX elements can have attributes, just like HTML elements can.

A JSX attribute is written using HTML-like syntax: a name, followed by an equals sign, followed by a value. The value should be wrapped in quotes, like this:

`my-attribute-name="my-attribute-value"`

### Here are some JSX elements with attributes:

`<a href="http://www.example.com">Welcome to the Web</a>;`

`const title = <h1 id="title">Introduction to React.js: Part I</h1>;`

A single JSX element can have many attributes, just like in HTML:

`const panda = <img src="images/panda.jpg" alt="panda" width="500px" height="500px" />;`

`const p1 = <p  id="large">foo</p>;
const p2 = <p  id="small">bar</p>;`


## Nested JSX
You can nest JSX elements inside of other JSX elements, just like in HTML.

### Here's an example of a JSX <h1> element, nested inside of a JSX <a> element:

`<a href="https://www.example.com"><h1>Click me!</h1></a>`

To make this more readable, you can use HTML-style line breaks and indentation:

`<a href="https://www.example.com">
  <h1>
    Click me!
  </h1>
</a>`

If a JSX expression takes up more than one line, then you must wrap the multi-line JSX expression in parentheses. This looks strange at first, but you get used to it:

`(
  <a href="https://www.example.com">
    <h1>
      Click me!
    </h1>
  </a>
)`

Nested JSX expressions can be saved as variables, passed to functions, etc., just like non-nested JSX expressions can! Here's an example of a nested JSX expression being saved as a variable:

`const theExample = (
   <a href="https://www.example.com">
     <h1>
       Click me!
     </h1>
   </a>
 );`

`const myDiv = (
   <div>
     <h1>
       Hello World
     </h1>
   </div>
 );`


## JSX Outer Elements
There's a rule that we haven't mentioned: a JSX expression must have exactly one outermost element.

In other words, this code will work:

`const paragraphs = (
  <div id="i-am-the-outermost-element">
    <p>I am a paragraph.</p>
    <p>I, too, am a paragraph.</p>
  </div>
);`

But this code will not work:

`const paragraphs = (
  <p>I am a paragraph.</p> 
  <p>I, too, am a paragraph.</p>
);`

The first opening tag and the final closing tag of a JSX expression must belong to the same JSX element!

It's easy to forget about this rule, and end up with errors that are tough to diagnose.

If you notice that a JSX expression has multiple outer elements, the solution is usually simple: wrap the JSX expression in a `<div></div>`.


## Rendering JSX
You've learned how to write JSX elements! Now it's time to learn how to render them.

To render a JSX expression means to make it appear onscreen.

**Instructions**
1. The following code will render a JSX expression:

`ReactDOM.render(<h1>Hello world</h1>, 
	document.getElementById('app'));`

JavaScript is case-sensitive, so make sure to capitalize `ReactDOM` correctly!

`
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
// redering code here:
ReactDOM.render(<h1>Hello world</h1>, document.getElementById('app'));`


## ReactDOM.render() 1
You can see something called ReactDOM. What's that?

**ReactDOM** is the name of a *JavaScript library*. This library contains several React-specific methods, all of which deal with the DOM in some way or another.


The ReactDOM's methods: `ReactDOM.render()`.

`ReactDOM.render()` is the most common way to render JSX. It takes a JSX expression, creates a corresponding tree of DOM nodes, and adds that tree to the DOM. That is the way to make a JSX expression appear onscreen.

`<h1>Hello world</h1>` is the first argument being passed to `ReactDOM.render()`. ReactDOM.render()'s first argument should be a JSX expression, and it will be rendered to the screen.


## ReactDOM.render() 2
Move to the right a little more, and you will see this expression:

document.getElementById('app')
You just learned that ReactDOM.render() makes its first argument appear onscreen. But where on the screen should that first argument appear?

The first argument is appended to whatever element is selected by the second argument.

In the code editor, select index.html. See if you can find an element that would be selected by document.getElementById('app').

That element acted as a container for ReactDOM.render()'s first argument! At the end of the previous exercise, this appeared on the screen:

<main id="app">
  <h1>Render me!</h1>
</main>
